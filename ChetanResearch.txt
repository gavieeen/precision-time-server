- This project explores using a Raspberry Pi 5 (or Compute Module 4) paired with a U-Blox F9T GNSS module to serve as a low-cost PTP grandmaster for precise time synchronization.
The GNSS receiver feeds pulse-per-second (PPS) and serial time data into the Pi, while gpsd collects satellite information and chrony keeps the Pi’s clock disciplined. 

- LinuxPTP tools (ptp4l and phc2sys) then distribute those precise timestamps to client devices over the network.

- By adjusting GNSS settings—such as data update rates and which satellite signals to accept—the team measures how these changes impact timing accuracy and signal quality.
Experiments show that faster measurement rates and using multiple satellite constellations can achieve microsecond-level sync. 

- Overall, this work demonstrates that affordable, off-the-shelf hardware plus open-source software can meet the tight timing demands of latency-sensitive applications like high-frequency trading.
